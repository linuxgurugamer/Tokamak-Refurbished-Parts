	Following changes from github user @taniwha
		Add a disambiguator for parts with multiple ports
		Adjust the control node positions.

		They now match the positions of the docking ports when extended such that
		docking indicator mods display the correct distance to the target port.

		They have been moved out 2.72m from the center (the positions of the
		docking port transforms when the habitat is inflated).

		Test the correct var for null.

		Create a module for setting the control reference.

		This module makes it possible to use any transform of the part to which it
		is attached as the reference transform ("Control From Here"). If the part
		has a ModuleCommand module, then the command on the ModuleCommand module is
		disabled in order to work around a stock bug where ModuleCommand does not
		ensure the part's reference transform is correct before setting the
		vessel's reference transform.

		Fix the loading of the reference transform submodel.

		Only the first "model =" line in a MODEL node has effect. To load multiple
		models into a part, multiple MODEL nodes are required. This fixes the
		problem of "Control from Here" not having the desired effect when used on
		the docking ports. It does, however, break "Control From Here" for the
		command module because ModuleCommand does not reset the part's reference
		transform before setting the vessel's reference transform.

		Use the correct module for internal flags.

		Was added for KSP 1.2. If it doesn't work, then there's no such transform
		in the model (it works for EL's workshop).

		Rewrite the DeployableHabitat module.

		It now works with ModuleAnimationGroup via IAnimatedModule. It keeps track
		of the number of crew members in the part to determine whether the part
		should be retractable and correctly updates the PAW for both crew transfer
		and retract-ability

		Make geeforce public to fix a warning.

		Quick and dirty makefile to ease building.

		It's not properly setup for Tokamak, but it works well enough for building
		in Linux.
